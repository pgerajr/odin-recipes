    <h4>These baked Buffalo wings are crispy without being fried. They take only 10 minutes to prep, but need to be refrigerated for about an hour so the flour coating is firm. You can add more cayenne or hot sauce if you like them spicier!</h4>
    <p>Believe it or not, you don't need a deep fryer to make the best Buffalo wings of your life. These sports bar-worthy wings are as crispy as it gets (thanks to an hour of refrigeration time before they hit the oven), but they don't require any oil — and they don't make a mess of your kitchen.</p>
