    <h4>A dish to remember and repeat infinte times.</h4>
    <p>In this grilled octopus recipe, tenderized octopus is char-grilled and drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil, a squeeze of fresh lemon, and a sprinkling of fresh parsley. Simple, yet deliciously satisfying!</p>
    
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 wine cork</li>
        <li>3 ½ pounds octopus, head and beak removed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ medium lemon</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon minced fresh parsley</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
       <li>Fill a large pot 1/2 full with water. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt, peppercorns, and the wine cork; bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
       <li>Meanwhile, place octopus on a cutting board. Using a wooden spoon or meat mallet, pound the octopus multiple times, starting in the middle and moving down each tentacle to tenderize the meat.</li>
       <li>Dip tentacles into the boiling water 3 times, holding them in the boiling water 2 to 3 seconds each time, until the tentacles curl up. Submerge entire octopus in the boiling water. Bring water back to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until octopus is fork-tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Remove from heat and cool for 30 minutes.</li>
       <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
       <li>Grill octopus until charred on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side.</li>
       <li>Remove from heat, slice into pieces, and place on a serving platter. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and squeeze lemon over the top. Sprinkle with parsley and season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.</li>
